<![CDATA[
Queries the repository for queryable object based on properties or an optional full-text string.  Relationship objects are not queryable.   Content-streams are not returned as part of query.<br>
<br>
Inputs:<br>
<br>
String statement: Query statement<br>
(Optional) Bool searchAllVersions: False (Default)<br>
(Optional) Boolean includeAllowableActions: False (default)<br>
(Optional) Enum includeRelationships: none (default), source, target, both<br>
(Optional) int maxItems: 0 = Repository-default number of items (Default)<br>
(Optional) int skipCount: 0 = Start at first position (Default)<br>
<br>
Outputs:<br>
<br>
Collection objectCollection - this collection represents a result table produced by the query statement. Typically each row of this table corresponds to an object, and each column corresponds to a property or a computed value as specified by the SELECT clause of the query statement. A CMIS SQL 1.0 query without JOIN always produces one object per row.<br>
Bool hasMoreItems<br>
<br>
Notes:<br>
<br>
If SearchAllVersions is True, and CONTAINS() is used in the query, OperationNotSupported will be thrown if full-text search is not supported or if the repository does not have previous versions in the full-text index.<br>
Returns set of objects from (skipCount, maxItems+skipCount)<br>
If no “maxItems” value is provided, then the Repository will determine an appropriate number of items to return. How the Repository determines this value is repository-specific and opaque to CMIS.<br>  
If “includeAllowableActions” is TRUE, the repository will return the allowable actions for the current user for each result object in the output table as an additional multi-valued column containing computed values of type string, provided that each row in the output table indeed corresponds to one object (which is true for a CMIS SQL 1.0 query without JOIN).<br>
If each row in the output table does not correspond to a specific object and “includeAllowableActions” is TRUE, then InvalidArgumentException will be thrown.<br>
It is recommended that “includeAllowableActions” be used with query statements without JOIN, and that the Object ID property or “*” be included in the SELECT list.<br>
"IncludeRelationships" indicates whether relationships are also returned for each returned object. If it is set to "source" or "target", relationships for which the returned object is a source, or respectively a target, will also be returned. If it is set to "both", relationships for which the returned object is either a source or a target will be returned. If it is set to "none", relationships are not returned.<br>
